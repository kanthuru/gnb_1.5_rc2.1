# CAUTION: DO NOT MODIFY ANY ENTRIES IN THIS FILE
# 
# [INFO]
# This file is for internal usage and is created for OAM Service to provide
# inputs of RFIC+FEM Control to L1-control FW. As the RFGPIO Pin mapping varies
# w.r.t each Board-type+RFIC card combination, the pin control has been
# abstracted into this file
#
# [PURPOSE]
# For each paired combination of EdgeQ board-type + RFIC Card, there are
# 5 set of routines that L1-control FW is dependent on,
# 1> Default state for all RFGPIO Pins needed for FEM+RFIC Control
# 2> State of RFGPIO Pins for Transmit ON/OFF Control
# 3> State of RFGPIO Pins for Receive ON/OFF Control
#
# [KEYWORDS]
# OAM Recognizes below keywords in the YAML file definition,
# * Board name prefixed with 'board_type_'
# * Supported RFIC prefixed with 'rfic_name_'
# * Grouping of pin states for the 5 defined events,
#   - default_state_sequence
#   - tx_on_sequence
#   - tx_off_sequence
#   - rx_on_sequence
#   - rx_off_sequence
# * rfgpio_pin_0 to rfgpio_pin_31 and state of the GPIO as 0/1
# * Each 'rfgpio_pin_N' entry defines a pair for RFGPIO Pin and its state
# * L1-control FW will take care of changing the state of pins at proper slot boundaries
#
# [GPIO PIN DELAY]
# The second argument for each pin gives the gpio pin advance/delay which is signed
# number in microsec to nanosec precision[for 1us ,the input should be 1000ns] which has to
# be updated per baord and its requirements,if its not mentioned default value 0 is taken
#        GPIO_PIN       [state , delay]
#for eg: rfgpio_pin_27: [0 , 1000]
