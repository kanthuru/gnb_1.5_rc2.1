This is a sample driver to show how we can initialize a device and make use of
interrupts to communicate between Linux and Zephyr.

Example of device tree node:

doorbell0: raptor2_doorbell@deadbeef {
	compatible = "edgeq,raptor2-doorbell";
	reg = <0x00 0xdeadbeef 0x0 0x01>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 254 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>, /* Linux IRQ */
		     <GIC_SPI 255 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>; /* Zephyr IRQ */
	zirq = <255>;
	label = "DOORBELL_0";
	status = "okay";
};

Configurations needed to enable driver:

CONFIG_RAPTOR2_DOORBELL=y
